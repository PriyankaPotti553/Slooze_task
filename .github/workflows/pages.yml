name: Deprecated - Pages workflow disabled

# This workflow has been intentionally disabled. The repository now uses the
# /docs folder and the repository Pages settings (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch: main /docs).
# To avoid accidental deployments, this workflow will not run for normal pushes.
